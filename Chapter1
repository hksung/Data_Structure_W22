## Introduction to Algorithm _ Chapter 1. The Role of Algorithms in Computing

### Algorithm and Data Structure

- Algorithm: well-defined computational procedure that takes some value
- Data structure: a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications
- (no single data structure works well for all purposes!)

### Algorithm as technology
- Computing time is therefore a bounded resource, and so is space in memory. You should use these resources wisely, and algorithms that are efficient in terms of time or space will help you do so.
- Efficiency: calculate running times
- Other technology
